# Emacs starter kit

This is my .emacs.d setup to work with the emacs-starter-kit (https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit). 

## Installation

You'll need Emacs 24, which comes with package.el. It's not hard to
compile [from source](http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacs), but
precompiled versions are readily available for
[Debian-based systems](http://emacs.naquadah.org/),
[Mac OS X](http://emacsformacosx.com/builds), and
[Windows](http://code.google.com/p/emacs-for-windows/updates/list).

* Install Emacs 24 and checkout this repository into ~/.emacs.d (make sure you have no ~/.emacs file).
* Copy a user specific config file to your username (e.g. cp pip.el bobb.el)
* Same for the color-theme (e.g. cp color-theme-pip.el color-theme-bobb.el)
* On first run, emacs should install all the required packages; this may take a while but should result in you being in a red on black coloured *scratch* buffer.
